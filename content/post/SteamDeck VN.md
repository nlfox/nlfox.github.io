### Locale

First you need to add required locate to system.
You can use this script:

It's a bit old so I recommend it to run line by line. 
This way in case of issue you won't mess things up.
After this you can put  `LANG=ja_JP.UTF-8 %command%` to launch configurations.

### Better manage your library on TF card

I recommend NTFS or exFAT

Above script should help auto mount shared drive between Windows and SteamOS
